# Cloudflare Pages routing configuration

# API routes are proxied to Workers
/api/* https://safe-ops-studio-workers.yosep102033.workers.dev/api/:splat 200

# Public OPS pages fallback to 404 which is handled by Next.js client-side routing
# Note: Direct /p/* access will show 404 briefly before client-side routing kicks in
# This is a limitation of Next.js static export with Cloudflare Pages
